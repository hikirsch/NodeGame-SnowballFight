#NodeGame: Snowball Fight - Oneday Branch#

This branch is a restructuring of all the code into modular pieces, and a reworking of the Client/Server communication
to follow more standard Multiplayer game methodology. 

Specifically it aims to mimic Quakeworld which relied on high latency low bandwidth connections.
