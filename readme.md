#NodeGame: Snowball Fight - Oneday Branch#

This branch is a restructuring of all the code into modular pieces, and a reworking of the Client/Server communication
to follow more standard Multiplayer game methodology.  

Specifically it aims to mimic Quakeworld/Source-SDK network model which is uses interpolation and client side movement prediction for smooth network play.  
Everything i'm trying to do is based on the two links below:  
[Quakeworld network model code review](http://www.fabiensanglard.net/quakeSource/quakeSourceNetWork.php)       
and here  
[Valve Source-SDK networking documentation] (http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Multiplayer_Networking)
